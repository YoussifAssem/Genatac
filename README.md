The most important aspect in determining a family is a person's DNA. One of the most significant phenomena that have spread around the world and illustrate everything about a person. For street children, orphaned children, persons who are make criminals, or men who dispute paternity to a child, we want to develop a method that analyses the whole genome or alleles. The system will utilize numerous algorithms to compare it to all of the people in our data set, checking for resemblance with each one, and then telling them what family this child may be related to. In addition, the algorithm can determine whether or not the child is connected to the father. Furthermore, we intend to expand our system in the future to help the police with their criminal investigations and help the court with the proving fatherhood case.
